Here's our awesome wedding site. Some of the neat features:

* Single-page, with hyperlinks at the top that let you "jump" to a section
* Scales nicely down to tablet and mobile sizes
* Based on bootstrap
* Uses LESS and grunt 

# Running

Just load `build/default.html` in your browser.

# Editing

Open iTerm to the 'Website' directory and type `grunt`. Will automatically insert livereload stuff. 

Adding a grunt plugin: `npm install grunt-plugin-name --save-dev`

# Publishing

    grunt finalize && git push
